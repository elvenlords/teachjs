# teachjs

This is an attempt to teach JS to a group of students who have minimal or zero introduction to programming. If this is your first attempt at learning programming, I would suggest you first learn HTML and CSS. HTML is not a programming language but is a markup language, and CSS helps  you to style markup languages. Everything you view on the web is in the end nothing but HTML and CSS.
