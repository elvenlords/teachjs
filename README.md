# teachjs

This is an attempt to teach JS to a group of students who have minimal or zero
introduction to programming. If this is your first attempt at learning programming,
I would suggest you first learn HTML and CSS. HTML is not a programming language
but is a markup language, and CSS helps  you to style markup languages. Everything 
you view on the web is in the end nothing but HTML and CSS.

## Learning JS

Javascript is a good lanugage to learn but since there are not "types" in it it would
be good if you don't stop programming by just learning JavaScript (from here on JS).
In this matter I would point you to Larry Wall's [advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR8fQiskYII)

An alternate list could be as follows

* C  (System Programming)
* C++ or Java  (Object Oriented Programming)
* Scheme or Haskell(Functional Programming)
* Python (Scripting)
* JavaScript (Web)

if you still have time, learn these as well

* PHP (Server Side Scripting)
* Golang (Server Side Performance)
* Bash (Linux Scripting)
* Lua (Game Scripting)


So let's begin with JS.

I would recommend you to get a course on Udemy, the best I have seen so far is by Brad Traversy.
He has very clean and beginner friendly courses on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It should not take
you more than 3x times the course duration to finish the courses.
